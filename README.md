# Supply Chain: Predicting deliveries

Today’s supply chains of today’s factories have become a complex, global-dependent infrastructure which depends on many factors to be able to coordinate a timely factory.  These interdependencies now rely on multiple factors to keep the supply chain moving.  
To help keep these factories on schedule, there must be a degree of foresight in how certain parameters will affect supplier performance.
When a factory drives their supply chain, there are planning techniques applied to a supply/demand system which relies on factory techniques using MRP (Manufacturing Resource Planning) and material lead-times to keep the factory supplied with material provided on time to minimize factory downtime.
I analyzed some features to show there is predictability ….

## Performing 9 Classification models shows there is a mix of correlation results.  Initial results show most models performed in the 80% range.  Recall and F1 scores did not perform so well.  
 

## Conclusion
The relationship between parts and delivery is a complex issue.  My model focused on features within an organization which are known and controlled features. The strongest correlation is on features related to item group, net price, weight.  This shows that item categories may be higher risk on being late such as electronics (longer lead time), as well as weight and cost due to shipping logistic related issues or costly commodities.  Along with these features, there many factors fall outside of the scope of direct correlation between part attributes and late parts.  Reason is there are many macroscopic influences outside the control and monitoring of an organization.  For example, geo-political events,
